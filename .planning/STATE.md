## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases derived from 61 requirements -- Infrastructure first, then multi-tenancy, read views, write ops, localization/UX, testing/deployment
- [Roadmap]: Multi-tenancy and security split into its own phase (Phase 2) because it is a hard dependency for all data access in Phases 3+
- [Roadmap]: Testing/deployment/monitoring grouped into final phase rather than spread across phases -- allows focused hardening after features complete
- [01-01]: Used .NET 10 SDK with .slnx solution format (new XML-based format in .NET 10)
- [01-01]: Created empty Blazor app with --empty flag for minimal starting point

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: MediatR licensing eligibility needs verification before Phase 1 -- consider Wolverine as alternative if ineligible
- [Research]: Exact session keys used by legacy WebForms app need auditing during Phase 1
- [Research]: Phase 5 localization may need research-phase if GetText + DB pattern proves non-standard
