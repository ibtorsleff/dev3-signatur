## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Row 2 Mode Tabs Visible
expected: Navigate to /activities. Row 2 (teal bar) shows 3 tabs: "Kladdesager", "Igangværende sager", "Afsluttede sager". The tabs are clickable links.
result: issue
reported: "Spelling mistake: 'Igångværende sager' should be 'Igangværende sager' in Row 2 nav. Also 'Igangvaerende sager' in headline should use proper Danish 'Igangværende sager'."
severity: cosmetic
fix: committed bcea9fa — corrected both NavigationConfigService.cs and ActivityList.razor.cs

### 2. Ongoing Mode Selected by Default
expected: On /activities, the "Igangværende sager" tab in Row 2 is visually highlighted/selected. The headline above the grid says "Igangværende sager (N)" where N is the count of ongoing activities. The grid shows activity rows.
result: pass

### 3. Row 1 Sagsliste Highlighted
expected: On /activities, the "Sagsliste" icon in Row 1 (white bar) is visually highlighted or has an active/selected state, distinguishing it from the other Row 1 icons.
result: pass

### 4. Switch to Closed Mode
expected: Click the "Afsluttede sager" tab in Row 2. The URL changes to /activities/closed. The headline changes to "Afsluttede sager (N)". The grid reloads showing only closed activities. The "Afsluttede sager" tab becomes selected.
result: pass

### 5. Switch to Draft Mode
expected: Click the "Kladdesager" tab in Row 2. The URL changes to /activities/draft. The headline changes to "Kladdesager (N)". The grid reloads showing only draft activities. The "Kladdesager" tab becomes selected.
result: pass

### 6. Switch Back to Ongoing
expected: From /activities/draft or /activities/closed, click the "Igangværende sager" tab. The URL changes back to /activities. The headline returns to "Igangværende sager (N)". The grid reloads with ongoing activities. No full page reload occurs (SPA navigation).
result: pass

### 7. Browser Tab Title Updates
expected: The browser tab title changes to match the current mode. On /activities it shows "Igangværende sager", on /activities/closed it shows "Afsluttede sager", on /activities/draft it shows "Kladdesager".
result: pass

### 8. Row 3 Hidden
expected: On any activity list page (/activities, /activities/closed, /activities/draft), Row 3 (dark teal sub-nav, 44px) is not visible -- it should be hidden or not rendered since there are no sub-navigation items for the activity list area.
result: pass

### 9. Activity Detail Navigation Still Works
expected: From the ongoing activity list (/activities), click an activity row. The browser navigates to /activities/{id} showing the activity detail page. The Row 2 tabs still show and "Igangværende sager" remains selected (detail pages are within the ongoing context).
result: pass
