## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Activity list loads without errors
expected: Navigate to the activity list (Ongoing mode). The page loads normally with no errors or crashes. The grid shows activities as before.
result: pass

### 2. ClientSection column hidden for client users
expected: When logged in as a client user (a user whose account belongs to a client organisation — ClientId > 0 in the session), the "Afdeling" (ClientSection/department) column does NOT appear in the activity list grid. The column should be absent, not just blank.
result: pass

### 3. ClientSection column visible for non-client users
expected: When logged in as an internal/portal user (ClientId is 0 or not set), the "Afdeling" (ClientSection) column IS visible in the activity list grid, showing the department name for each activity.
result: pass

### 4. Copy action column respects CreateActivity permission
expected: For a user who does NOT have the RecruitmentPortalCreateActivity permission, the copy/action icon column is hidden in the activity list (Ongoing mode). For a user who DOES have this permission, the column is visible. (Draft mode always hides the column regardless of permission.)
result: pass
