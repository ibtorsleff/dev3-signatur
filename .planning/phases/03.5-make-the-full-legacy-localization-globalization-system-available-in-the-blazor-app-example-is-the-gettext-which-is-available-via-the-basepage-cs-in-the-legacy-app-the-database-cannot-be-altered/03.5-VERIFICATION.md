# Phase 03.5: Legacy Localization System Re-Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** The full legacy localization/globalization system is available in the Blazor app

**Verified:** 2026-02-17T00:32:13Z  
**Status:** PASSED  
**Re-verification:** Yes - after gap closure from UAT failures

## Re-Verification Summary

Previous verification (2026-02-16T23:59:07Z) passed with 6/6 truths verified.

UAT testing identified 2 issues: Navigation labels and portal name not displaying bracket notation for unresolved keys.

Root cause: Inverted fallback logic in NavMenu.razor.cs that suppressed bracket notation.

Gap closure: Plan 05 executed, removed bracket-check conditions.

Result: All gaps closed, no regressions.

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths - 8/8 VERIFIED

1. ILocalizationService.GetText returns database-backed translations with cache warming - VERIFIED
2. Language fallback chain works - VERIFIED
3. Per-user language resolution based on UserLanguageId - VERIFIED
4. ActivityList page has zero hardcoded Danish strings - VERIFIED
5. Navigation labels use localization keys - VERIFIED
6. Admin cache management page exists - VERIFIED
7. Navigation labels display bracket notation when DB keys missing - VERIFIED (gap closed)
8. Portal name displays bracket notation when DB key missing - VERIFIED (gap closed)

### Artifacts - 13/13 VERIFIED

All artifacts exist and are substantive (proper line counts, non-stub implementations).

### Key Links - 6/6 WIRED

All connections verified: cache patterns match, DI registrations present, components use services.

### Requirements Coverage - 4/4 SATISFIED

All localization requirements met.

## Gap Closure Details

UAT Test 3: Navigation labels showing hardcoded text instead of bracket notation
- Fix: Removed StartsWith check from ResolveLabel (commit c989a2d)
- Verified: No bracket suppression logic in NavMenu.razor.cs

UAT Test 4: Portal name showing hardcoded text instead of bracket notation
- Fix: Removed StartsWith check from ResolvePortalName (commit c989a2d)
- Verified: No bracket suppression logic in NavMenu.razor.cs

## Verification Summary

Status: PASSED

All must-haves verified. Phase goal achieved. Ready to proceed.
