# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 03.5-01
    provides: ILocalizationService with GetText, IMemoryCache, language fallback chain
provides:
  - ActivityList page fully localized via ILocalizationService.GetText
  - PascalCase English key naming convention for localization keys
affects: [03.5-03, 03.5-04, future-page-localization]

# Tech tracking

    - src/SignaturPortal.Web/Components/Pages/Activities/ActivityList.razor.cs

key-decisions:
  - "PascalCase English identifier keys (DraftActivities, ColumnHeadline, etc.) as placeholders -- exact legacy DB keys matched during full migration"
  - "L alias for ILocalizationService via [Inject] property -- concise Razor template syntax"

patterns-established:
  - "L.GetText pattern: inject ILocalizationService as L, call L.GetText('KeyName') in both .razor and .razor.cs"
  - "Column title localization: Title=\"@L.GetText('ColumnXxx')\" for all PropertyColumn elements"

# Phase 3.5 Plan 02: ActivityList Localization Summary

**All hardcoded Danish strings in ActivityList replaced with ILocalizationService.GetText calls using PascalCase English keys**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-16T23:50:21Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-16T23:51:51Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Replaced 3 hardcoded Danish headline strings (Kladdesager, Igangvaerende sager, Afsluttede sager) with GetText calls
- Replaced filter toggle tooltips (Skjul filtre, Vis filtre) with GetText calls
- Replaced 10 column Title attributes with GetText calls using descriptive keys
- Replaced static UI text (ContinuousPosting, CopyActivity, NoActivitiesFound, ErrorLoadingActivities) with GetText calls

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Localize ActivityList headline, tooltips, column titles, and static text** - `5371a35` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/SignaturPortal.Web/Components/Pages/Activities/ActivityList.razor` - All column titles, tooltips, and static text replaced with L.GetText calls
- `src/SignaturPortal.Web/Components/Pages/Activities/ActivityList.razor.cs` - ILocalizationService injected, headline and error text localized

## Decisions Made
- PascalCase English identifier keys used as placeholders (DraftActivities, ColumnHeadline, ShowFilters, etc.) -- exact legacy DB key matching deferred to full migration
- ILocalizationService injected as `L` for concise template usage

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- ActivityList page fully localized, ready for next plan (03.5-03)
- Localization keys will show [KeyName] bracket notation until Localization table is populated with matching entries
- Pattern established for localizing other pages in future plans
